(** An implementation of "external sorting" (sorting on-disk data) and various
    other related routines.

    Most of these routines work with mmap-ed data, as a one dimensional array of
    integers, where each pair of integers represents a [(key,value)] pair.

    These routines exist to support the implementation of the sparse file. The
    documentation in the sparse file should also be read.

    Usage: We start with a file containing [(off,len)] pairs. These describe
    which regions of a file contain data that we need when creating a sparse
    file. We first sort these by offset, using {!sort}. We then combine adjacent
    extents using {!calculate_extents_oc}. For example, a region [(10,10)] and a
    region [(20,10)] will be combined into the single extent [(10,20)]. When
    combining extents, we also want to allow some flexibility if two regions are
    "almost adjacent". For example, a region [(10,10)] and a region [(21,10)]
    will be combined into the single extent [(10,21)], even though there is a
    single byte at offset 20 that we do not actually need. The parameter
    [gap_tolerance] defines how large this gap between regions can be for them
    to be combined in this way. The reason for doing this is that we want the
    sparse file to have a small map if possible, and we are happy to include
    some unneeded data in the sparse data file if this will make the map
    smaller. *)

    the [arr] to be sized as a multiple of [chunk_sz].

    The implementation reads chunk-sized amounts of ints into memory as a list
    of tuples, sorts the list, and writes the list back out.

    [chunk_sz] is the number of ints that are kept in memory, and so the overall
    memory usage is something like [8 * chunk_sz] (with some overhead for the
    list.. FIXME perhaps an array would be better) *)
